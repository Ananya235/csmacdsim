# 🛰️ MAC Access Protocols Simulator

### *(Slotted ALOHA, CSMA/CD)*

An interactive **Streamlit-based web application** that simulates and visualizes the performance of two key **Medium Access Control (MAC)** protocols:
**Slotted ALOHA**, **CSMA/CD**.

This simulator helps you understand how multiple nodes compete for a shared communication channel, how collisions occur, and how different access strategies improve throughput and efficiency.

## Features

### Interactive Controls

* **Number of Nodes (N)** – Set how many devices share the channel.
* **Transmission Probability (p)** – Set how likely each node is to transmit per time slot.
* **Propagation Delay Factor (α)** – Adjust for CSMA/CD to simulate real propagation effects.
* Real-time metrics:

  * Offered Load: **G = N × p**
  * Throughput (S)
  * Efficiency (%)
  * Channel Utilization (%)

## Theory Overview

### Slotted ALOHA

* Time is divided into slots.
* A node transmits **only at the start of a slot**.
* A **success** occurs if exactly one node transmits.
* A **collision** occurs if two or more transmit at once.
* Idle if no node transmits.

**Throughput formula:**

> S = G × e<sup>−G</sup>

**Maximum efficiency:**

> S<sub>max</sub> = 1/e ≈ 0.368 → 36.8%

### CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)

Nodes **listen before transmitting**:

* If channel is idle → transmit immediately.
* If busy → wait and retry according to persistence type.

| Type           | Behavior                                 | Typical Efficiency |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1-Persistent   | Waits until idle, then transmits         | ~50–60%            |
| Non-Persistent | Waits random backoff before retrying     | ~60–70%            |
| p-Persistent   | Transmits with probability *p* when idle | Tunable            |

**Approximate throughput model:**

> S ≈ (G × e<sup>−aG</sup>) / (1 + 2aG)

where **a = propagation delay / transmission time**.

As **a → 0**, efficiency approaches **100%**.

---

### CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)

Used in **Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)**.
Enhances CSMA by **detecting collisions while transmitting**.

When a collision occurs:

1. Transmission stops immediately.
2. A **jam signal** is sent.
3. Node waits for a **random backoff** (Binary Exponential Backoff).

**Efficiency formula:**

> η = 1 / (1 + 5a)

where **a = propagation delay / transmission time**.

**Examples:**

* a = 0.01 → η ≈ 95%
* a = 0.1 → η ≈ 66%

Efficiency falls as propagation delay grows.
